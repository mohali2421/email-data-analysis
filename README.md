# Email Data Analysis and Visualization

In this project, I analyzed a dataset of email communications to extract meaningful insights using Python and data visualization techniques. The goal was to understand communication patterns, key topics, and temporal trends within the email data.

## Steps Taken

- Cleaned and preprocessed the raw email data
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Created visualizations:
  - Word clouds for common topics
  - Time-series plots for email volume over time
- Used Python libraries: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `wordcloud`

## Key Findings

- Identified most active senders and frequent keywords
- Discovered spikes in email activity on specific dates
- Communicated insights through clear visualizations

## Benefits

This project shows the ability to work with real-world text data and extract valuable insights using Python. The same approach can be applied to other communication datasets for strategic improvements.

## Requirements

Install with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
